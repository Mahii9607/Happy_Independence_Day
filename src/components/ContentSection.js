      <h3>History of Independence Day</h3>
      <p>
        India gained independence from British rule on August 15, 1947, following a long and
        hard-fought struggle led by key figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and many others. 
        This day is celebrated annually as Independence Day, with patriotic fervor and a commitment 
        to the ideals of freedom and democracy.
      </p>
      <h3>Celebrations Across the Nation</h3>
      <p>
        Every year, the Prime Minister of India hoists the national flag at the Red Fort in Delhi, followed 
        by a speech addressing the nation. Across the country, people participate in flag-hoisting ceremonies, 
        cultural events, and remember the sacrifices made by the freedom fighters.
